# Chest_X-ray_report_generator_using_deep_learning

In this project, we present a deep learning model for generating captions for the Chest X-ray reports. Radiology
reports are a critical aspect of medical diagnosis and treatment planning. Chest X-ray images are commonly used
to diagnose various lung diseases, and their interpretation requires highly trained medical professionals.
Generating accurate and comprehensive chest X-ray reports can be a time-consuming and expert-driven task. To
address this issue, we developed a deep learning-based system for chest X-ray report generation. 

The system uses DenseNet a convolutional neural network (CNN) based network to analyse chest X-ray images and generate
corresponding reports with captioning by help of GRU. Our model generates reports using the input chest X-ray
images, and aims to provide a more efficient and cost-effective solution for healthcare professionals. The image
caption generator extracts relevant features from the X-ray images and generate descriptive captions that
capture important details such as abnormalities, disease progression, and treatment options. 

The model is trained on a large dataset of chest X-ray images and corresponding reports, and is implemented using a deep
learning framework. We evaluate the performance of our model using standard metrics, and demonstrate its
effectiveness in generating accurate and coherent reports.

## Future Works
1) We will try to increase our model accuracy by using Attention model instead of Encoder-decoder.
